# Install and Configure LDAP on Windows Server 2022 Using GUI

This guide outlines how to install and configure Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) on a Windows Server 2022 domain controller using the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Prerequisites
- A Windows Server 2022 system configured as a domain controller.
- Administrator access to the server.

---

## Step 1: Confirm Active Directory is Installed
LDAP is part of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). Ensure AD DS is installed and the server is configured as a domain controller.

1. Open **Server Manager**.
2. Verify that the **Active Directory Domain Services** role is installed.

---

## Step 2: Install Additional Features (If Necessary)

1. Open **Server Manager**.
2. Click **Add roles and features**.
3. Proceed through the wizard:
   - On the **Server Roles** page, ensure **Active Directory Domain Services** is selected.
   - On the **Features** page, ensure the following features are installed:
     - **Group Policy Management**
     - **RSAT: Active Directory Administration Center**
     - **RSAT: Active Directory Users and Computers**
4. Complete the wizard and install missing features, if necessary.

## Step 3: Enable LDAP Over SSL (Optional but Recommended)

To enable secure LDAP (LDAPS):

1. **Obtain or create an SSL/TLS certificate** for the domain controller:
   - **Use a Certificate Authority (CA):** Request a certificate from an internal or external CA that includes the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the domain controller.
     - Open **Server Manager**.
     - Go to **Tools > Certification Authority**.
     - Issue a certificate for the domain controller.
   - **Create a self-signed certificate:**
     - Open **PowerShell** and run the following command:
       ```powershell
       New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "<FQDN>" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\LocalMachine\My"
       ```
       Replace `<FQDN>` with the domain controller's FQDN.

2. **Install the certificate:**
   - Open **Run**, type `mmc`, and press **Enter**.
   - In the MMC console, go to **File > Add/Remove Snap-in**.
   - Select **Certificates**, then choose **Computer account** and click **Next**.
   - Select **Local Computer** and click **Finish**.
   - Navigate to **Certificates (Local Computer) > Personal > Certificates**.
   - Right-click the **Personal** folder, choose **All Tasks > Import**, and follow the wizard to import the certificate.

3. **Restart the Active Directory Domain Services service:**
   - Open **Run**, type `services.msc`, and press **Enter**.
   - Locate **Active Directory Domain Services** in the list.
   - Right-click and select **Restart**.

## Step 4: Configure LDAP Settings

### Verify LDAP Functionality

1. Open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
2. Use LDAP queries to search for objects in the domain:
   - Right-click the domain root and select **Find**.
   - Use **Custom Search** or **LDAP Query**.

### Test the LDAP Connection

1. Open **LDP.exe** (Run `ldp.exe`).
2. Connect to the domain controller:
   - Use the FQDN of the domain controller.
   - Use port **389** for LDAP or **636** for LDAPS.
3. Bind using domain credentials.

---

## Step 5: Verify Ports and Firewall

Ensure the required ports are open:

| Protocol  | Port | Purpose        |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| TCP       | 389  | LDAP           |
| TCP       | 636  | LDAP over SSL  |

### Configure Firewall Rules

1. Open **Windows Defender Firewall**.
2. Go to **Advanced Settings**.
3. Add inbound rules for ports **389** and **636**, if not already present.

---

## Step 6: Test LDAP Access

Use an LDAP client to test access:

- **LDP.exe** (built into Windows).
- Third-party tools like **Softerra LDAP Browser** or **Apache Directory Studio**.

---

## Notes
- LDAP is inherently part of Active Directory. No additional installation is needed if AD DS is configured.
- To customize schemas or organizational units, use **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
